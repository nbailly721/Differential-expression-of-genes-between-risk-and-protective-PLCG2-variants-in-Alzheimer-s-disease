                                          ######Differential expression of genes between risk and protective PLCG2 variants in Alzheimer's disease######
-This project analyzes differential gene expression between risk and protective PLCG2 variants in Alzheimer's disease using RNA count data.

##📁 Dataset

GSE308813_20240829_LB_rna_counts_only.csv (Source: NCBI. Acession number:GSE308813) — Raw RNA counts for multiple samples across different genotypes.

##🔧 Tools & Packages

Language: R
Packages: R.utils, tidyverse, DESeq2

##📊 Workflow Overview

Data loading and renaming of columns for clarity

Filtering genes with low counts (<100 total reads)

Metadata creation to label sample groups (WT, KO, risk, prot)

Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 comparing risk vs protective variants

Visualization of results with MA plot

Identification of significantly upregulated and downregulated genes

##📈 Key Results

List of genes significantly upregulated or downregulated in risk vs protective variants

MA plot visualizing expression differences and significance

##🧠 Notes

Filtering ensures only sufficiently expressed genes are analyzed to reduce noise.

DESeq2 normalization accounts for library size and variability.

Results focus on contrast between risk and protective PLCG2 variants to understand molecular impact.

Script includes detailed comments for reproducibility and clarity.
